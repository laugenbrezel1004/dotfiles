# Why I got the installation script
I am just to lazy to manually install all dotfiles on my servers at home. So the idea is to put some time in a installation script and just execute it, when i want my dotfiles or my Hyprland config.
# Backup your old .config
It's best when you backup your old .config directory, just in case. Backing up the .vimrv and .zshrc is certainly not wrong either.
# Adapt to your system
The configurations are tailored to my system, so you may still have to adjust one or two things 
# Download and execute the script
Be aware that ths script is not finished yet, so be careful when executing it.
It is also a good idea to familiarize yourself with the content of the script before you execute it!
